Classifying future NBA players

The 2018 NBA draft is still a long way off. College basketball is only entering conference play and mock drafts will undergo many iterations over the next three to four months. 

However, it might be useful to better understand what metrics can help us pinpoint a draft pick's future value above replacement (VORP) in the NBA. For reference, our 270-plus NBA player sample averaged a 1.46 VORP. Each sampled player was classified as  having either above or below average VORP (1,0 binary response). 

We classified players using their college statistics and physical features (as measured at the NBA combine). A random forest model was used to predict (classify) whether a given college player would achieve an above or below average VORP in the NBA.

The random forest model correctly classified 64.3% in terms of having either above or below average VORP. This is definitely better than random guessing but not a fool-proof method to evaluate college prospects entering the draft.
